Conceding to a shareholder revolt, Occidental Petroleum’s longtime chairman, Ray R. Irani, on Friday stepped down from the board, essentially forced into retirement a year ahead of schedule.

The decision, announced at the company’s annual meeting, was the climax of a brutal boardroom struggle between Mr. Irani and Stephen I. Chazen, the chief executive during the last two years, over leadership and direction of the company. Earlier this week, the Occidental board bowed to investor pressure by announcing that Mr. Chazen would continue to serve in his position through the end of 2014 and help find a successor.

The company announced that Edward P. Djererjian, a former ambassador in the Middle East who has served as an independent director since 1996, will assume the role of independent chairman of the board, and that former Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham will become the independent vice chairmen. Both were elected by the board.
