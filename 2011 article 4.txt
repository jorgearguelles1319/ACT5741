OXY
-2.71% 
Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s OXY, -2.71% third-quarter earnings rose 49% as higher selling prices for oil and natural-gas liquids boosted the top line.

Occidental's earnings have continued to improve this year due higher oil prices and increased production in the U.S. It has also posted strong results in its chemicals business.

The company this month took the first step toward restarting production at Libyan oilfield it partially owns, making it the first U.S. company to get some crude back up in the country since Moammar Gadhafi's overthrow.

Average daily oil and natural-gas production grew 4.7% from the second quarter to 739,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day as higher domestic volumes offset by lower production in the Middle East, North Africa and Colombia. Average prices increased 34% for oil, while natural-gas liquids prices climbed 41% worldwide, though domestic natural gas prices declined.

Occidental reported a third-quarter profit of $1.77 billion, or $2.17 a share, up from $1.19 billion, or $1.46 a share, a year earlier. Per-share earnings from continuing operations rose to $2.18 from $1.48 as revenue jumped 26% to $6.01 billion.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected a $1.95 per-share profit with revenue of $5.7 billion.

Revenue in the company's main oil and gas segment rose by a third as profit increased 49%. Chemical sales grew 17%, pushing profit up 30%.

Shares closed at $87.20 Wednesday and were inactive premarket. The stock is off 11% this year.
